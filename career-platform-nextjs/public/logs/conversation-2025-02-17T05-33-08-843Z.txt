A: Hey, have you heard about the Climate Summit happening in Glasgow?

B: Yes, I read about it. It's incredible that world leaders are coming together to tackle climate change. What are the main goals of the summit?

A: Well, one of the primary objectives is to set new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. You know, gases like carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming.

B: Right, and I think it's crucial they focus on the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. Those are often the ones who suffer the most from extreme weather events and rising sea levels.

A: Absolutely. It’s imperative that the summit addresses adaptation strategies and resilience building for those communities. By the way, have you heard about the term 'climate justice'?

B: I think so, but remind me what it means?

A: Climate justice is a term used to frame global warming as an ethical and political issue, rather than just an environmental one. It emphasizes how climate change disproportionately affects poor and marginalized communities.

B: That makes sense. It’s important that the summit not only creates policies to reduce emissions but also ensures equitable solutions for all. Do you think these discussions will lead to significant change?

A: It’s hard to say, but raising global awareness and cooperation is a step in the right direction. The success of the summit will depend on the commitment of the participating countries to implement the agreed-upon measures.

B: I hope they make meaningful progress. The future of our planet depends on it.
